This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in COBOL programs: numeric overflow.  The example shows a quantity field (WS-QTY) that is checked for overflow before processing. However, if the data type of WS-QTY is not large enough to handle the potential input values, an overflow may occur before the explicit check, leading to unpredictable behavior. This is particularly dangerous as there may not be an explicit error message, leading to silent data corruption.  The solution provides an improved check that verifies the input data type is large enough to prevent overflow before any other operations are performed.
