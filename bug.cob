000010  IF WS-QTY > 99999999. THEN 
000020      DISPLAY "QUANTITY FIELD OVERFLOW." 
000030      STOP RUN. 
000040  END-IF. 

In this snippet, there's a potential for an overflow issue. If the value in WS-QTY exceeds 99,999,999, the program displays an error message and stops. However, depending on the data type of WS-QTY, the overflow could occur before this check, causing unpredictable behavior or silent data corruption.
